This repository is essentially a collection of files developed by Matthew Lee. 
They all allow for the collection of display of survey data on a Google Map. 
You will need your own API key to use this software. 
If you want to check it out just clone the repository and have a play.
It is designed to work on any server that supports PHP 4.0 or above. 
Feel free to add branches to expand the idea. 
I have annotated the index page to make it easier to understand the web application. I will seek to add further annotations to the JavaScript and PHP files to simplify any further development.
I will be posting a distribution that uses OpenLayers over the next few days.
